# Process-Scheduler
welcome to one of the most interesting and enjoyable project I have worked on, I enjoyed working on this amazing cpp project where I applied many design concepts to get an effective structure with many solutions for various problems, this project marks the first intensive program I worked with a beautiful and hard language 'mother of modern programming' which is the superior CPP.


A complete Object-oriented C++ program that performs a non-trivial task, which is simulating the operation of the process scheduler in a multiprocessor system and calculates some related statistics in order to help improve the overall scheduling system
